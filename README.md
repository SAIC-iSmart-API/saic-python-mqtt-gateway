# SAIC MQTT Gateway

A service that queries the data from an MG iSMART account and publishes the data over MQTT.

MG iSMART is the connectivity system in your MG car (MG5, MG4, ZS...).

The implementation is based on the findings from
the [SAIC-iSmart-API Documentation](https://github.com/SAIC-iSmart-API/documentation) project.

## Prerequisites

* You have an iSMART account (can be created in the iSMART app)
* Your car needs to be registered to your account

## Configuration

Configuration parameters can be provided as command line parameters or environment variables (this is what you typically
do when you run the service from a docker container).

### Charging Station Configuration

If your charging station also provides information over MQTT or if you somehow manage to publish information from your
charging station, the MQTT gateway can benefit from it. In addition, the MQTT gateway can provide the SoC to your
charging station.

An [openWB](https://openwb.de) charging station is capable of providing information over MQTT for instance. You just
need to provide the configuration in the file charging-stations.json. A sample configuration for two cars connected to
an openWB charging station would be the following.

Check-out the [sample file](charging-stations.json.sample)

The key-value pairs in the JSON express the following:

| JSON key              | Description                                                                                       |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| chargeStateTopic      | topic indicating the charge state - **required**                                                  |
| chargingValue         | payload that indicates the charging - **required**                                                |
| socTopic              | topic where the gateway publishes the SoC for the charging station - optional                     |
| chargerConnectedTopic | topic indicating that the vehicle is connected to the charging station - optional                 |
| chargerConnectedValue | payload that indicates that the charger is connected - optional                                   |
| vin                   | vehicle identification number to map the charging station information to a vehicle - **required** |

## Running the service

### From Command-line

To run the service from the command line you need to have Python version 3.12 or later.
Launch the MQTT gateway with the mandatory parameters.

```
$ python ./mqtt_gateway.py -m tcp://my-broker-host:1883 -u <saic-user> -p <saic-pwd>
```

### In a docker container

Build the image yourself with the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) or download the image
from [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/saicismartapi/saic-python-mqtt-gateway).

#### Building the docker image

```
$ docker build -t saic-mqtt-gateway .
```

There is a [docker compose file](docker-compose.yml) that shows how to set up the service.

## A Better Route Planner (ABRP) integration

Telemetry data from your car can be provided to [ABRP](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/). **Be aware that this is not
done by default.** The data will be sent only if you provide the mapping of your vehicle identification number (VIN) to
an ABRP user token.

## Commands over MQTT

The MQTT Gateway subscribes to MQTT topics where it is listening for commands. Every topic in the table below starts
with the default vehicle prefix: `saic/<saic_user>/vehicles/<vehicle_id>`

| Topic                                    | Value range              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Home Assistant auto-discovery

The gateway supports [Home Assistant MQTT discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt#mqtt-discovery). It
publishes configuration information so that the vehicle appears as a MQTT device. This will save you a lot of
configuration effort since all the entities provided by the vehicle will automatically show-up in Home Assistant.
